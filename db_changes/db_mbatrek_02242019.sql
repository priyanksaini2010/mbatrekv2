This means that your business school and / or undergraduate course has created the perfect working machine. This goes beyond traditional soft skills and communication skills which are typically part of any career mentoring and coaching advice that one will receive from college professors and faculty. Delivering on Day 1 of the job means knowing how corporate IT systems work, how CRM systems work, how power structures and created and managed in an organization, how everyday decision making happens.

In fact all the fuss about AI (Artifical Intelligence) and ML (Machine Learning) is because it provides systems to generate insights from data and then taken relevant data backed and insights-driven decisions.

Before you start to prepare for a new job or starting hunting new roles in the market because you feel bored or saturated with your current profile, think twice - Have you achieved what you wanted to do with this role, team, and company. If not, stick and deliver until the end, the results will come.

This is where you are exposed to multiple disciplines in both the arts, sciences and social sciences. However most of us don\'t think about our careers, till the task of finding a job actually hits you in your pre-final year and final year of under-graduation or graduation.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: large;\">In India, this issue is more pronounced as young people only start thinking about their careers and jobs after the first few years in the professional world. Most decisions taken at this time are made out of spite and are typically knee-jerk reactions. Most young people know very well what they don\'t want to do in their careers even though they may be well qualified for those paths. The rationale for these decisions are purely emotional and not based on tangible data and therefore a lot of time at the start of the career is lost to re-alignment.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: large;\">To avoid the situation of re-alignment, two to three years in one\'s career, a young student while still pursuing their academic course should follow the Self-Career-Industry-Company-Job Role funnel process.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Let\'s get into the details of the funnel:</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span style=\"color: #229897; font-size: x-large;\"><strong>1. Self Awareness:</strong></span> Before you start thinking about your engineering stream (B.Tech. or B.E. in Computer Science, Electronics, Chemical, Electrical, Environmental, Civil, etc.) or MBA specialization (Marketing, HR, Operations, IT, Strategy etc.) or undergraduate majors (B.Com., BBA etc.) you need to understand yourself very well. Ask yourself the following questions:</span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><span style=\"font-size: large;\">What are my interests in life?</span></li>\r\n<li><span style=\"font-size: large;\">How do I interact with people and what kind of people would I like to work for?</span></li>\r\n<li><span style=\"font-size: large;\">How comfortable I am with very diverse and non-traditional environments?</span></li>\r\n<li><span style=\"font-size: large;\">What would be my ideal workplace?</span></li>\r\n<li><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Do I want to be out in the field or in a nice cozy corporate office?</span></li>\r\n<li><span style=\"font-size: large;\">How will I be successful in life?</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<div><span style=\"font-size: large;\">At MBAtrek, we have created a unique assessment tool called <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><span style=\"color: #229897;\"><strong><a title=\"Me and Myself Assessment\" href=\"https://survey.zohopublic.com/zs/idCsyy\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"color: #229897; text-decoration: underline;\">Me and Myself Assessment</span></a>&nbsp;</strong></span></span>which will help you understand yourself better.

Behavioral Analyses:</strong> </span>Now that you have a fair understanding of yourself, you need to understand how you interact with the external environment. This is where you need to conduct a detailed behavioral analysis to understand key personality triggers. Key areas that you should look at:</span></div>\r\n<div>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Team Player tendencies</span></li>\r\n<li><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Stress Management abilities</span></li>\r\n<li><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Emotional Stability</span></li>\r\n<li><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Passion for work</span></li>\r\n<li><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Responsibility / Accountability levels</span></li>\r\n<li><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Self Starter abilities</span></li>\r\n<li><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Open to Learning</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</div>\r\n<div><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a title=\"Do connect with our team\" href=\"../../contact-us\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><span style=\"color: #229897; text-decoration: underline;\">Do connect with our team</span></strong></a></span> in case you are looking for a detailed behavioral profile.

Cognitive Assessments:&nbsp;</strong></span>Most students and young professionals are fairly familiar with cognitive assessments often offered in the form of IQ tests. More often than not, most people make the mistake of focusing on the overall score from a cognitive or IQ assessment. The key is to actually focus on which segment of the assessment, did you demonstrate higher scores to be used as a proxy for capability:</span></div>\r\n<div>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Numerical Ability</span></li>\r\n<li><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Data Analysis</span></li>\r\n<li><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Abstract Reasoning</span></li>\r\n<li><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Attention to Details</span></li>\r\n<li><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Critical Thinking</span></li>\r\n<li><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Reasoning Ability</span></li>\r\n<li><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Verbal Ability</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<div><span style=\"font-size: large;\">The different abilities and the competency across them will give one a strong sense of what kind of industries, companies, work environments and job roles that you would succeed in.&nbsp;<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a title=\"Do connect with our career advisory team\" href=\"../../contact-us\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><span style=\"color: #229897; text-decoration: underline;\">Do connect with our career advisory team</span></strong></a></span>&nbsp;in case you are confused with what your IQ / cognitive score report actually means for your career.</span></div>\r\n<div><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><br /></span></div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span style=\"color: #229897; font-size: x-large;\"><strong>4.

More importantly, a GD is a great way for employers to see you in a real-life simulation of an activity which happens every-day at work -it\'s called meetings and conference calls.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: large;\">It helps the employer explore an individual\'s confidence, team spirit, ability to deal with a chaotic and unstructured environment and express themselves in a structured manner. Please remember often when you are going in for meetings at work, thoughts and structure is really present. Can you be the person driving structured communication! Group discussions are also a test of your logical and analytical skills and your competence to deliver on them in a high pressure and high stakes environment.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: large;\">The question which most students face are:</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #229897;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: large;\">What skills are judged in a Group Discussion?</span></strong></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Let&rsquo;s start with the skills and behavioral elements that you are being judged on in a group discussion exercise:</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: large;\">1.

It gets a little too late and there is actually no scope of going back to the past to sort the things out.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: large;\">So here are a few pointers to help you get on track for the 2-year journey:</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Most students sit back and relax or party, taking for granted that they have secured a seat in a top quality B-school, thinking that everything will fall in place automatically. But this is the greatest folly committed by most MBA graduates and by the time they realize, it gets too late.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span style=\"color: #229897;\"><strong>Take your First Year courses seriously</strong></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Specialization is just a part of an MBA program. Your 1st-year courses build the foundation of your overall management knowledge and basics. In case you are still confused and have not made up your mind regarding the field of specialization - don\'t worry! There are going to be multiple opportunities during your program to choosing your specialization of interest.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #229897;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Effective Time Management</span></strong></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Considering only 720 days in hand and a whole lot of things that can be achieved, MBA graduates usually run short of time. It is a race against time. Be an organized student and engage yourself in activities which are going to be worthwhile and will be helpful in corporate skill building and development (i.e. structured communication, logical skills, presentation skills etc.). Right from the start, you should ensure that deadlines are deadlines and should be met come what may.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #229897;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Strengthening Your CV / Resume - Every Time and All the time</span></strong></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: large;\">One must continuously participate in various activities and competitions organized both at the B-school and inter B-school level. Your CV / Resume should start having meaningful work from live projects showcased on it along with innovative approaches to solving case competitions.

Don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re going to sit down and hammer it out in an hour. &ldquo;You have to think carefully about what to say and how to say it so the hiring manager thinks, \"This person can deliver on what I need for this job profile\".</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: large;\">One of the many preconceptions about a resume is that it is all about you - Like <span style=\"color: #229897;\"><strong>any strong piece of advertising</strong></span>, it&rsquo;s not about the product being sold &ndash; <span style=\"color: #229897;\"><strong>it&rsquo;s about the buyer and what they want</strong></span>. There are different ways to format your resume, depending on your employment history and experience. For someone who is a recent graduate, for example, the prime focus will be on their achievements at college and primarily on their academic performance. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: large;\">The right structure will highlight this. If someone has had large gaps in their employment history, breaking from the traditional resume format can allow them to bring focus on their skills and distract from the gaps. It&rsquo;s common fact that employers and hiring managers don&rsquo;t take the time (<span style=\"color: #229897;\"><strong>an average of 20 to 30 seconds on every resume</strong></span>) to read through resumes in the initial round: They simply scan. <span style=\"color: #229897;\"><strong>So, focus on the employer&rsquo;s needs, not yours</strong></span>. This may be your best chance to make a good first impression. Therefore, take the time to properly organize your resume is worth the investment.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Here are a <strong><span style=\"color: #229897;\">few handy tips</span></strong> to get you going:</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: large;\">1. <span style=\"color: #229897;\"><strong>Strong Objective / Summary:</strong></span> A short blurb telling the hiring manager what skills, knowledge, and abilities you have that will help the company achieve its goals.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: large;\">2. <span style=\"color: #229897;\"><strong>Keep it Real:</strong> </span>Avoid clich&eacute; sentences. Don&rsquo;t just make-up nice sounding words to describe yourself &ndash; make sure that the traits you claim to have are actually reflected in the bullet points on your resume</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: large;\">3. <span style=\"color: #229897;\"><strong>Contact Information:</strong> </span>Contact information should be listed at the top where it is easy to find and employers need not have to hunt around for a way to contact you. Things which may be included in this section: your name, address, phone numbers, email address and website, if applicable. Depending on the role you&rsquo;re applying for, you should also include any social media accounts you&rsquo;d like employers to see.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: large;\">In conclusion, writing a resume involves more than <span style=\"color: #229897;\"><strong>simply listing job experiences and education</strong></span>. It must be a clear representation of you as a current or future working professional: including your skill sets, qualifications, and career goals minus the unnecessary add-ons. Avoid lengthy paragraphs, lists of uninteresting hobbies or unclear section breaks that reduce the overall quality of the resume.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Make sure your Resume is just not about a good looking but has the right quality content to really showcase your experience and skills.

Here&rsquo;s an attempt to decode why.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: large;\">B-Schools work exceptionally hard to facilitate the generation of several hundred job offers for graduating students in a matter of a few days. In the melee of <strong><span style=\"color: #229897;\">on-campus placements, students seldom objectively evaluate the &ldquo;why&rdquo; behind the jobs they seek</span></strong>.&nbsp; Career choices are mostly made <strong><span style=\"color: #229897;\">basis heuristic principles</span> </strong>passed down from their <span style=\"color: #229897;\"><strong>seniors, folklore around the &ldquo;prestige&rdquo; of certain roles/firms, and information provided by recruiters</strong> </span>during campus outreach programs.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: large;\">As a result, a large number of graduating students end up aspiring for a few &ldquo;dream&rdquo; jobs in the domains of Consulting/ Investment Banking/FMCG etc. Securing such a job is often viewed as the hallmark of success among peers and celebrated as the beginning of all good things in life. <strong><span style=\"color: #229897;\">Disturbingly, for those who wish to yet fail to secure these &ldquo;dream&rdquo; jobs, such rejection can cause deep mental trauma and a sense of absolute dejection.&nbsp;</span></strong>&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: large;\">What students need to ask themselves is, <span style=\"color: #229897;\"><strong>whose &ldquo;dream&rdquo; is it anyway?</strong></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: large;\">As someone who&rsquo;s been through that rite of passage, here&rsquo;s my best advice &ndash; <span style=\"color: #229897;\"><strong>don&rsquo;t go by popular perception of a job&rsquo;s desirability to you</strong>.</span> Invest time in <strong><span style=\"color: #229897;\">identifying what gives you the real kicks in life</span></strong>. Identify your best skills and what you want to <strong><span style=\"color: #229897;\">achieve as a professional</span></strong>. That should be the only reason &ldquo;why&rdquo; you want a certain job.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Does this work? Here&rsquo;s one name that&rsquo;ll dispel any doubts on the practicality of such an approach &ndash; Cheteshwar Pujara.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Pujara was REJECTED by every IPL team &amp; went unsold at the IPL 2019 auctions held on December 18, 2018. In short, he was found UNFIT to play the most &ldquo;popular&rdquo; cricketing format on the planet! How did he react to this seemingly disastrous outcome?</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Eight days later in Australia, playing in the test series against the home team, he came out all guns blazing in the 3rd Test Match and scored a match-winning century for India. He didn&rsquo;t stop there, he also scored a masterful 193 runs in the 4th Test to become only the 3rd Indian ever to score 3+ Test centuries on an Australian tour. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Resultantly, he won the &ldquo;Man of the Series&rdquo; award. Basically, declared the architect for India&rsquo;s first ever Test Series victory in Australia!</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Cheteshwar Pujara created history BECAUSE he had clearly identified his own niche (Test cricket) and gave his 100% to succeed at it!</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: large;\">If you are an MBA candidate and nodding along, you can do it too!

For a generation of Indian students and young professionals, who were schooled in just <strong><span style=\"color: #229897;\">developing IQ and being the most intelligent worker</span></strong> in a team, there are troubled times ahead. Increasingly, all positions in the corporate world and non-corporate world are demanding enhanced EQ and people skills even at the entry level. The traditional soft skills are becoming the <strong><span style=\"color: #229897;\">new hard skills</span></strong>. All this has been captured very eloquently in the <a title=\"WEF Future of Jobs Report 2018\" href=\"http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Future_of_Jobs_2018.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><span style=\"color: #229897; text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>WEF Future of Jobs Report 2018</strong></span></span></a>. The table below highlights how traditional skills will be declining in 2022.</span></p>\r\n<p><img style=\"vertical-align: middle;\" src=\"https://assets.weforum.org/editor/Zm-zai8pI_FhHbIHHDcHqt1pAS0X5199KRNWg5e_To4.PNG\" alt=\"2018 to 2022: Top 10 Skills Demand\" width=\"1193\" height=\"419\" /></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: large;\">The above table shows eight common skills in the Top 10 which are emerging in 2018 and trending in 2022. There are only two skills that have been added in from 2018 to 2022 - namely <strong><span style=\"color: #229897;\">Technology Design and Programming</span></strong> and <strong><span style=\"color: #229897;\">Systems Analysis and Evaluation</span></strong>. With the subsequent rise of <span style=\"color: #229897;\"><strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong> </span>and <span style=\"color: #229897;\"><strong>Machine Learning</strong></span>, there tends to be a lot of focus on <span style=\"color: #229897;\"><strong>Technology Design and Programming</strong> </span>skills. However, most students and young professionals miss out the other nine fundamental skills that need to be harnessed before one becomes useful for organizations as a productive employee. Increasingly, more people are being hired and promoted who are able to do execute on <span style=\"color: #229897;\"><strong>&ldquo;systems-based thinking&rdquo;</strong></span> as highlighted in the WEF report as a trending skill in 2022. As the world enhances its inter-connectivity due to improved networking and connectivity infrastructure, there is strong demand for individuals who can think holistically and build and execute strategies for interconnected systems and processes.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Another key area to explore with the WEF report is the declining skill set in 2022. Especially in India, there is substantial focus on rudimentary corporate skills including but not limited to <span style=\"color: #229897;\"><strong>memory</strong> </span>(how quickly can I memorize things), <span style=\"color: #229897;\"><strong>verbal</strong></span> (i.e. quality of one&rsquo;s English), and <span style=\"color: #229897;\"><strong>operational</strong></span> (management of people, finances and materials) skills. By 2022, especially in large organization, these skills will be largely executed by self-learning automated processes. The human contribution to organizations at large will be around innovating and creating new avenues of business rather than maintaining the status quo.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><br /></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Best of Luck,</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Abhishek Srivastava (<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><span style=\"color: #229897;\"><a title=\"LinkedIn Profile\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/abhishek-mbatrek/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"color: #229897; text-decoration: underline;\">LinkedIn Profile</span></a></span></span>)</span></p>\r\n<p><em><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Abhishek is the co-founder and CEO of MBAtrek and extremely passionate about mentoring and coaching young professionals.
