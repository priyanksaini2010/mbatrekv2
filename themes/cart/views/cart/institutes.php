					<p>As a recruiter or a HR lead or a hiring manger
					, do you feel that your new hires and younger 
					professionals are struggling to cope with the 
					corporate life and your company&apos;s culture. Infact, 
					you will even notice that their productivity and idea
					generation and execution capabilities are also
					limited. Why do you believe this happens?</p>

<p>This is a combination of lack of preparedness from the young 
graduate / early stage professionals in terms of being a &apos;Ready&apos; and 
&apos;Relevant&apos; professional. In addition, you maybe spending very little 
time on both the formal and in-formal on-boarding process.</p>

<p>Infact a HBR study in June 2017, has summarized that that new hires
 are very vulnerable in the first 3 to 6 months and by extending the 
 on-boarding time to close toone year, companies are significantly
 able to control attrition and help new hires perform better.Infact 
 in some cases, the study quotes that 91% of the first year employees
 were retained with an efficient and effective on-boarding process.
