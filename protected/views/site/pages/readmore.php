<p>For surviving and generating revenue, the universities have dropped their entry barriers for students but in the meanwhile have not been successful in keeping pace with the industry. Due to this gap, the industry presence in campuses go down and the quality jobs are missed out by many universities.</p>

<p>Moreover, the students passing out from these institutes do not perform at par with those graduating from top- tier colleges.</p>
